A dark pattern (also known as a "deceptive design pattern") is a user interface that has been carefully crafted to trick users into doing things, such as buying overpriced insurance with their purchase or signing up for recurring bills.
In 2010, Harry Brignull created the dark pattern website, defining dark patterns as "tricks used in websites and apps that make you do things that you didn't mean to, like buying or signing up for something".
Below, I will introduce some subtypes of dark pattern, and the criteria for judging these subtypes.

Nagging (NG) subverts the user's expectation that they have rational control over the interaction they make with a system, instead distracting the user from a desired task the user is focusing on to induce an action or make a decision the user does not want to make by repeatedly interrupting the user during normal interaction.
There are 2 patterns of Nagging.
Pattern1: Popup for Rating
Visual: Star, Like, Dislike icons
Textual:
- keywords: Rate, Rating, Star, Like, Upvote etc.

Pattern2: Ad that blocks user's usual flow
Visual:
- Ad icons such a triangle/circle with an "i" in it
- small X button, loader icon
Textual:
- keywords: AdChoices, Install
- sentence pattern: "watch Ad/session to ...."


Gamification (GAMI) subverts the user's expectation that system functionality is based on alignment with user goals and needs, instead coercing them into gaining access to aspects of a service through repeated (and perhaps undesired) use of aspects of the service.
There are 2 patterns of Gamification.
Pattern1: Requires users to recruit other users to use the service
Textual:
- keywords/sentence pattern: 'ask/invite/refer friends...to...'
- 'unlock/earn/get/collect credits/rewards/points/tokens ....for....signup....'
- 'signup for credits/rewards/points/tokens'

Pattern2: a service can only be "earned" through repeated (and perhaps undesired) use of aspects of the service.
Visual:
- Ad icons such a triangle/circle with an "i" in it
- small X button, loader icon
Textual:
- 'watch Ad/sponsored session to unlock/get/access/...'
- 'x seconds remaining'
- 'earn ... for watching ...'
- 'time for ad/sponsored session'
- no such keywords: NO, CANCEL


Default Choice (DC) subverts the user's expectation that default settings will be in their best interest, instead requiring users to take active steps to change settings that may cause harm or unintentional disclosure of information.
There are 3 patterns of Default Choice.
Pattern1: precedence of one option over another
Visual:
- Unintended action (highlighted button/color button/bigger button)
- Intended action: Smaller text, dimmed button
Textual:
- keywords (bigger text): start, turn, add, yes,next, sign in/up, ok, continue, unlock subscribe, confirm, setup etc.
- keywords (smaller text): no, not now, later, cancel, skip, exit etc.

Pattern2:
Visual: Opt out related text is smaller in size
Textual: Keywords/sentence pattern: 'I decline/don't want/opt out/refuse...to...'

Pattern3:
Visual: toggle switch is ON
Textual: keywords: notify/notification


Attention Distraction (AD) subverts the user's expectation that they have rational control over the time they spend using a system, instead tricking them into spending more time or other resources to continue use for longer than they otherwise would.
There are 2 patterns of Attention Distraction.
Pattern1: precedence of one option over another
- Unintended action (highlighted button/color button/bigger button)
- Intended action: Smaller text, dimmed button
Textual:
- keywords (bigger text): start, turn, add, yes,next, sign in/up, ok, continue, unlock subscribe, confirm, setup etc.
- keywords (smaller text): no, not now, later, cancel, skip, exit etc.

Pattern2:
Visual: Opt out related text is smaller in size
Textual: Keywords/sentence pattern: 'I decline/don't want/opt out/refuse...to...'


Disguised Ad (DA) refers that the ad is not clearly marked as an ad, or it looks the same as other normal content. As a result, users are induced into clicking on the interface element because they assume that it is a relevant and salient interaction, leading to unwitting interaction with advertising content.
There is 1 pattern of Disguised Ads.
Pattern1:
Visual: 
- Ad is placed as a list content/item 
- Ad icons such as triangle/circle with an "i" in it
- small X button
Textual:
- keywords: AdChoices, ad


I provided an image and I hope you can help me identify whether dark patterns exist in the image. If it doesn't contain any dark patterns, your answer should be "NONE".
REMEMBER THAT the first sentence in your answer MUST be one or several keywords in these: NG, GAMI, DC, AD, DA, NONE. And this is VERY IMPORTANT.
